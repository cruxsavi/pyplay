### :notes: Music player writen with *Python* and *PySide6* which is fully compatible with *PyQt6* :smiley:.

To install install dependancies just run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run `app.py`.
To work with with <mark>PyQt6</mark> just edit imports by changing `from` *`PySide6`* to *`PyQt6`*.
